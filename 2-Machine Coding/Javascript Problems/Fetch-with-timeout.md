# Fetch Method with Timeout in JavaScript

## Introduction

In JavaScript, sometimes we want to set a time limit for an API call, ensuring that it doesn't hang indefinitely. This is especially useful in scenarios where we want to prevent long waiting times for the user. In this article, we'll see how to create a `fetch` method with a timeout in JavaScript.

## Fetch Method with Timeout Implementation

Let's implement a simple `fetchWithTimeout` function that combines the native `fetch` API with a timeout mechanism.

```javascript
async function fetchWithTimeout(url, timeout) {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
    const data = await response.json();
    clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Clear the timeout since the request was successful
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example Usage
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/data';
const timeoutDuration = 5000; // 5 seconds

try {
  const result = await fetchWithTimeout(apiUrl, timeoutDuration);
  console.log('API response:', result);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Request terminated or failed:', error.message);
}
```

## Explanation

1. We use the `AbortController` to create a controller object associated with the fetch request.
2. `setTimeout` is used to trigger the `abort` method of the controller after the specified timeout duration.
3. Inside the `try` block, we perform the fetch request using the provided URL and pass the controller's signal to the `fetch` options.
4. If the request is successful, we parse the JSON response, and if it fails or times out, we catch the error and log it.
5. We clear the timeout if the request is successful to prevent it from firing after the request is completed.

## Interview Question

A common interview question related to this topic could be framed as follows:

**Possible Interview Question:**
*"Can you implement a `fetchWithTimeout` function in JavaScript that terminates the API call if it takes longer than a specified duration? Explain how you would handle the timeout scenario and what components you would use for this implementation."*

In your response, you can emphasize the use of `AbortController`, `setTimeout`, and how to structure the `fetch` request to incorporate the timeout mechanism.
